<h2>Dataset</h2>

<p>
This project draws on two complementary datasets focused on residential real estate transactions and ownership patterns in the City of Boston. Together, they enable both transaction-level and neighborhood-level analysis of speculative investment and ownership trends over more than two decades.
</p>

<p>
The first dataset contains all residential sales transactions in the City of Boston from 2000 to 2023. It includes detailed information about each sale, such as buyer and seller identities, sale price, property location, and whether the transaction qualifies as a “flip.” This dataset allows for the examination of investor participation over time, calculation of flip profits, and identification of spatial concentrations of speculative purchasing. Because it spans more than twenty years, it enables analysis of long-term trends, including changes before and after major economic events such as the 2008 financial crisis.
</p>

<p>
The second dataset contains neighborhood-level corporate ownership rates and owner-occupancy rates from 2004 to 2024. It provides aggregate measures of the proportion of housing stock owned by corporations as well as the proportion occupied by owners living in their properties. This dataset allows for analysis of broader structural shifts in ownership patterns, including the rise of absentee or corporate ownership and potential declines in resident ownership. By linking these ownership trends with transaction-level data, the analysis can explore how speculation and financialization may be reshaping Boston’s housing market spatially and over time.
</p>

<p>
I am particularly interested in these datasets because they allow investigation of housing not only as a social good but also as a financial asset. By combining transaction-level evidence of investor behavior with neighborhood-level ownership patterns, this project can begin to assess whether Boston’s housing market is increasingly serving speculative investment rather than resident stability.

<h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>

<h3>1. Has investor participation in Boston’s housing market increased over time (2000–2023), particularly among larger and institutional investors?</h3>
<p>
The MAPC report <em>Homes for Profit</em> documents a rise in investor purchases across Greater Boston, with particular concern about larger and institutional actors accumulating housing stock. In this project, I define investor participation using the <code>investor_type_purchase</code> classification, which categorizes buyers as “Non-investor,” “Small,” “Medium,” “Large,” or “Institutional.” While all investor categories are of interest, special attention will be given to medium, large, and institutional investors, as these actors are more likely to operate at scale and potentially influence housing market dynamics.
</p>

<p>
Using these classifications, I aim to examine whether the overall share of investor purchases has increased over time, and whether growth is primarily driven by small-scale investors or by larger and institutional entities. This distinction is important because prior reporting, including ProPublica’s <em>When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord</em>, suggests that institutional consolidation of housing stock may have different implications for affordability and market power than small-scale investment.
</p>


<h3>2. Where is speculative investment geographically concentrated within Boston?</h3>
<p>
Prior research indicates that investor activity is often spatially concentrated rather than evenly distributed. The <em>Homes for Profit</em> report documents clustering of investor purchases in particular municipalities, raising the question of whether similar geographic patterns exist within Boston neighborhoods. Using spatial indicators such as latitude, longitude, and ZIP code, I aim to identify whether institutional or large investors are concentrated in certain areas, and whether these concentrations align with luxury cores, rapidly appreciating neighborhoods, or historically lower-income communities.
</p>

<h3>3. How profitable are property “flips,” and has flip profitability changed over time?</h3>
<p>
A central claim in <em>Homes for Profit</em> is that investors extract significant profits through short-term resale of properties. This dataset includes pre-engineered flip indicators (<code>flip_ind</code>, <code>flip_term</code>, <code>price_diff</code>, <code>price_diff_pch</code>) that allow for direct analysis of holding periods and resale gains. I aim to quantify the distribution of flip profits, examine whether profitability has increased alongside rising housing prices, and determine whether short-term flips generate particularly high returns. This question engages with the broader theme of housing functioning as a speculative asset.

  <h2>Data Quality Assessment</h2>

  <p>
    Prior to conducting substantive analysis, we performed a structured data quality assessment focusing on three core components of the study: (1) investor purchase magnitude and outliers, (2) geographic coordinate validity, and (3) flip profitability and ownership diagnostics. These checks ensure that observed patterns reflect genuine market behavior rather than distortions introduced by extreme values, misclassification, or linkage inconsistencies.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Investor Purchase Volume and Outlier Assessment</h3>

  <p>
    Because institutional purchases appeared to generate substantially higher annual transaction value than other investor groups, we investigated whether this difference was driven by a small number of extreme transactions. We compared raw annual value distributions, log-scaled distributions, and IQR-filtered boxplots across investor types.
  </p>

    <figcaption>
      This multi-panel visualization evaluates whether institutional dominance in annual purchase value is driven by extreme outliers. The raw boxplot (upper-left) shows a pronounced right tail among institutional transactions, with several exceptionally large purchases exceeding typical market levels. The log-scaled panel (lower-left) reveals that even after adjusting for skewness, institutional purchases remain structurally higher than those of large, medium, and small investors. The IQR-filtered panel (lower-right) confirms that institutional investors still transact at substantially larger scales even after removing extreme outliers. Together, these panels demonstrate that institutional dominance is not solely an artifact of a few anomalous transactions but reflects a consistent structural difference in purchase magnitude.

  <h3>2. Geographic Coordinate Validation</h3>

  <p>
    Spatial concentration analysis relies critically on accurate latitude and longitude coordinates. During exploratory inspection, we identified placeholder values and coordinates outside Boston’s geographic bounds. Rather than rely on visual density artifacts, we applied a geographic filter restricting latitude and longitude to Boston’s valid coordinate range.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transactions with coordinates outside Boston’s bounding box were excluded prior to generating density maps. This ensures that spatial clustering results reflect actual neighborhood-level investor concentration rather than misplaced or missing geocoding entries.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Flip Profitability and Transaction Integrity Diagnostics</h3>

  <p>
    The profitability analysis required careful validation of flip-specific variables, including holding period (<code>flip_horizon</code>), dollar profit (<code>price_diff</code>), and percentage return (<code>price_diff_pch</code>). Several structural inconsistencies emerged during initial exploration:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Negative holding periods, indicating transaction ordering errors.</li>
    <li>Near-zero implied purchase prices generating artificially inflated returns.</li>
    <li>Extreme right-tail percentage returns driven by denominator distortions.</li>
  </ul>

  <figure>
    <img src="/Imgs/flip_data_quality_diagnostics_grid.png" alt="Flip Data Quality Diagnostics">
    <figcaption>
      This diagnostic grid summarizes key data integrity checks for flip transactions. The upper-left panel reveals negative holding periods, which are economically impossible and signal transaction linkage errors. The upper-right panel shows the distribution of implied purchase prices on a log scale, where a small left tail of near-zero values (e.g., $1 transfers) would artificially inflate percentage returns. The lower-left panel presents the raw return distribution, where extreme right-tail values reflect denominator distortions rather than genuine market gains. The lower-right panel displays the cleaned return distribution after filtering implausible transactions. The stabilized distribution demonstrates that observed flip profitability patterns are not driven by structural data artifacts.

  </figure>

  <h3>Summary of Data Integrity Procedures</h3>

  <p>
    Across investor purchase magnitude, spatial coordinates, and flip profitability variables, we applied conservative yet economically grounded filtering criteria. Extreme outliers were evaluated rather than mechanically removed; invalid geographic coordinates were excluded to preserve spatial validity; and structurally inconsistent flip records were filtered to maintain arithmetic coherence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Importantly, these procedures did not eliminate substantive market patterns. Institutional dominance persists after outlier control, and speculative profitability remains present after cleaning extreme distortions. The resulting dataset therefore provides a reliable foundation for examining investor concentration, speculative flipping behavior, and structural shifts in Boston’s housing market.
